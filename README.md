# Lost-and-Found.it

## Project Description
Lost-and-Found.it is a back-end web-server that can be used by businesses or institutions to help match lost items with their owners. Finders of lost items can post an item into the web-server, inventorizing the lost and found. Those who lost items can post an lost request, and be notified through text should there be a match in the database.
